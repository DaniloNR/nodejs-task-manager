A API built using pure Node.js v20.10.0. It implements a file-based database, a stream service for adding multiple tasks and provides a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for managing the tasks.

## Features

- CRUD operations for managing tasks
- File-based database implementation
- A stream module for uploading multiple tasks through a csv file

## Requirements

- Node.js v20.10.0
- csv-parse library

```sh
git clone https://github.com/DaniloNR/nodejs-task-manager.git

```

3. Install dependencies:
